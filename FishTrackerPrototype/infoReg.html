      <p>In Ontario it is pretty simple to get the nessesary equipment
        in order to fish. Firstly you will need a rod, reel, line, and
        bait. All of this can be purchased from any store that carries
        fishing equiptment, but to name a few there is Canadian Tire,
        Bass Pro Shops, and even Walmart has some of this equipment.</p>
      <p>For licences and to see the regulations for what area you are
        fishing, click the link below and read the very informative
        page by the government of Ontario!</p>
